Eq 02|MovEq|Eq 02: Hamilton's Equations|$\dot{q}=\frac{\partial H}{\partial p}$, $\dot{p}=-\frac{\partial H}{\partial q}$|These two equations describe the dynamics of a physical system in terms of generalized coordinates $q$ and their conjugate momenta $p$. $\dot{q} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p}$ describes how the generalized coordinates $q$ change with time. It states that the rate of change of a coordinate $q$ is given by the partial derivative of the Hamiltonian $H$ with respect to the corresponding conjugate momentum $p$. In other words, it describes how the positions evolve in response to changes in momentum. $\dot{p} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q}$: This equation describes how the conjugate momenta $p$ change with time. It states that the rate of change of momentum $p$ is equal to the negative partial derivative of the Hamiltonian $H$ with respect to the corresponding generalized coordinate $q$. This equation reveals how momentum changes due to variations in position.|Bunge, 1967, p. 123

This change is determined by the dot product of a generalized momentum vector $P$ and the gradient (nabla, $\nabla$) of the Hamiltonian function $H$. This equation is a fundamental element of Hamiltonian mechanics and describes how coordinates evolve in response to variations in momentum and the Hamiltonian energy function.|Bunge, 1967, p. 123
Eq 04|MovEq|Eq 04: Hamilton-Jacobi Equation|$\frac{\partial S}{\partial t}+H=0$|This equation expresses the conservation of the action $S$ with respect to time $t$ in the Jacobian theory. It states that the rate of change of the action with respect to time, represented by the partial derivative $\frac{\partial S}{\partial t}$, is equal to minus the Hamiltonian $H$ of the system. In other words, it asserts that the total action of the system, when combined with the Hamiltonian, remains constant over time. |Bunge, 1967, p. 123
