GR 5.2|Typ|Tipification for components of T||The components of $\mathrm{T}$ are real valued functions of $\bar{\sigma}$, $k$, $X$ and $t$.<br>The components of $\mathrm{T}$ vanish outside $V$.|Bunge, 1967, GR 5.2
GR 6.3|Typ|Postulate||Two solutions of Einsteins’s equation which can be transformed into one another by an admissible coordinate transformation refer to the same field.|Bunge, 1967, GR 6.3
Mass Additivity|Typ|Mass additivity||For every $\sigma\in\Sigma$, if $b\hat{=}\sigma$ and $C$ is the image of $b$ under $X$, then $M$ is a Continuous function of the volume (Lebesgue measure) $\mu(b,t)$ of $b$ at $t$.<br>b) For any two distinct $\sigma,\sigma'\in\Sigma$, if $b\hat{=}\sigma$ and $b’\hat{=}\sigma’$, and $b\cup b'\hat{=}\sigma+\sigma'$, then $M(b\cup b')=M(b)+M(b')$.<br>c) If $b\hat{=}c$, then $M(b)$ represents the mass of $\sigma$.|Bunge, 1967, CM 1.6
Mass Conservation|Typ|Mass conservation||For every $\sigma\in\Sigma$, if $b\hat{=}\sigma$ and $C=X(b,t)$ and $C’ =X’(b)$ are two different configurations of $\sigma$ at a given time $t$, then the corresponding masses are the same: $M(\sigma)=\underset{X(b)}{\int}d^{3}x\varrho_{X}=\underset{X’(b)}{\int}d^{3}x\varrho_{X'}$|Bunge, 1967, CM 1.7
PM 2.5|Typ|Postulate: Position and velocity values uniquely identify a particle||For any two $\sigma,\sigma'\in\Sigma$ and every $k\in K$ and every $t’\in T$, if $X\left(\sigma,t,k\right)=X\left(\sigma',t,k\right)$ and $\dot{X}\left(\sigma,t,k\right)=\dot{X}\left(\sigma',t,k\right)$, then $\sigma=\sigma’$.<br>In words: the position and velocity values uniquely identify (characterize) a particle. Coordinates alone are insufficient for this: thus two different particles may be at the same place at the instant of collision but then they will have different (vector) velocities.|Bunge, 1967, PM 2.5
PM 3.2|Typ|The mass of a system of point particles equals the sum of the partial masses||If $\sigma_{i}\in\Sigma$ for every finite $i\in N$, then $M\left(\underset{i}{\dot{\sum}}\sigma_{i}\right)=\underset{i}{\sum}M(\sigma_{i})$.|Bunge, 1967, PM 3.2
Postulate|Typ|Postulate: Once a particle always a particle||For any two different $t$, $t'\in T$, ir $\sigma\in\Sigma$ at $t$, then $\sigma\subset\Sigma$ at $t’$.<br>This postulate is needed in order to warrant that predictions and retrodictions calculated for a $Sigma$ on laws of motion and initial conditions will still refer to $Sigma$.|Bunge, 1967, PM 2.2
Tensor Degeneration|Typ|Tensor degeneration||When the constitutive tensor degenerates into $(\epsilon,\mu^{-1})$, the field equations become $\nabla\times E=-\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial B}{\partial t}$, $\nabla\cdot B=0$,<br>$\nabla\times H=-\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial D}{\partial t}+\frac{4\pi}{c}j$, $\nabla\cdot D=4\pi\rho$.|Bunge, 1967, p.
