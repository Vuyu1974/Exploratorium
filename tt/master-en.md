At the *Exploratorium*, we delve into the intricate semantic structures of physical theories. Our mission revolves
around creating interactive, hyperlinked network visualizations – macroscopes
designed to unravel the foundations of scientific theories.

#### Discover ten macroscopes

Step into the realm of physical and space-time theories with our interactive
visualizations of hierarquical networks. We have disected several set theoretical classifications  from recognized philosophers of science into a data base of models and their attributes. We have analysed formal contexts to extract their formal concepts and visualized hierarquical networks. Nodes represent concepts, while links illustrate
hierarchical relations of inclusion in interactive networks that display extra information. 

#### Our goal: unveiling complexity, facilitating understanding

At the heart of our mission is the commitment to providing visual, interactive
tools that demystify the complexity of physical theories and illustrate theory reconstructions. These macroscopes
serve as conceptual maps, guiding students and curious minds through the
theoretical sea of physics. Our aim is to illuminate the relations between
fundamental components, fostering a deeper understanding of the intricate
world of physics.

Join us at the *Exploratorium*, where curiosity meets visualization, and the
beauty of theoretical exploration unfolds before your eyes.

### Theoretical Framework

```{ .json .config }
{

  "navlang": "frame-es.html"
}
```

#### Metatheoretical Structuralism: Unveiling the Essence of Scientific Theories

The theoretical framework of the *Exploratorium* has its roots in metatheoretical structuralism, a branch of analytical philosophy of science. Structuralism aims to understand the relationships between the fundamental constituents of theories using set theory and an approach based on three units of analysis: models, theoretical elements and theoretical networks. This research program is found in the seminal book "An architecture for science", written by Balzer, Moulines and Sneed (2012).

Theoretical elements are represented through sets of model classes, as well as ligatures, intentional applications, historical and biographical data. The formal core is described by models, characterized by complying with certain axioms, forming among them a conceptual system that we visualize as lattices through the methodology of formal concept analysis (FCA). By classifying attributes using colors we can easily identify where the various classes of axioms come in, be it the declaration of domains (fields or geometric objects), typifications, conditions, equations, parameters, reference frames and spatio-temporal characterizations, among others.

In addition to models and theoretical elements, metatheoretical structuralism also takes theoretical networks as a unit of study. Hierarchical networks that take various theoretical elements as nodes. The networks that we propose here only consider actual models and some previous and other specialized models as objects, leaving aside characteristics related to intentional applications, historical data and the scientific community, focusing on the formal core. The theoretical grids presented here provide a synchronic perspective of theoretical development.

For its part, the *Gravity Apple Tree*, in addition to the most general principles, pays attention to the dates and puts the authors of the different alternative gravitation proposals on the map. Furthermore, it contrasts the theoretical space with the empirical space by including data referring to experimental advances in the matter. There you will find links to the seminal articles of the different theories and a diachronic perspective of scientific development.

### Methodological Framework

```{ .json .config }
{
  "template": "index.tt",
  "output": "methodology.html",
  "navlang": "methodology-es.html"
}
```


The methodological approach of the *Exploratorium* is grounded in the examination and construction of hierarchical networks known as lattices. This class of networks is distinguished by its properties as partially ordered sets, establishing a comprehensive hierarchy.

#### Hierarchical networks

Lattices have the property that for any pair of nodes there is only one minimal node and one supreme node. These hierarchical characteristics are updated within the domain of theoretical frameworks, the fundamental components universally applicable to various theories are strategically located at the top. This upper level encompasses entities such as protophysics, topological complexities, and geometric properties, while lower levels house current and specialized models, reflecting a nuanced hierarchical organization.

#### Formal Concept Analysis

Starting from formal contexts represented by incidence tables (G,M,i), our methodology establishes intricate relationships between classes of models (objects) and their associated attributes, that is, sets of axioms. **Formal Concept Analysis (FCA)**, a mathematical theory based on Birkhoff lattice theory and the Galois connection, plays a fundamental role. FCA systematically recovers formal concepts (certain ordered pairs of objects and attributes), organizes them hierarchically and represents them as frameworks, offering a deep insight into the structural interdependencies of the concepts.

#### Navigating Additive and Subtractive Paths

Every lattice featured here traces its roots to a meticulous formal reconstruction, revealing two distinctive paths:

**Additive Reconstruction:** Following the trajectory proposed by Bernhard Riemann and Mario Bunge (1967), this path commences with a modest differential manifold, subsequently enriched with geometric properties. Explore lattices titled "Protophysics," "Analytical Dynamics," and "Basic Theories."

**Subtractive Reconstruction:** Originating from Felix Klein's proposition, this path initiates with a differential manifold endowed with broad properties that are selectively constrained. This methodology is evident in Michael Friedman's (1983) classifications, Clifford Will's (1981) taxonomy, and Sotiriou and Faraoni's (2010) "f(R) Theories," as well as Mendoza and Barrientos' (2018) "Extended Theories." These reconstructions, sharing formalism and notation, converge seamlessly into a cohesive theoretical holon.

### Protophysics

```{ .json .config }
{
  "template": "diagram-page.tt",
  "output": "theories/en/protophysics/index.html",
  "navlang": "theories/es/protophysics/index.html"
}
```

The foundations of all physical theories rest on mathematical
theories, logic, semantics and a series of very general assumptions
and theories that in *Foundations of Physics* (1967), Mario Bunge
divides into three groups: the formal base, the material base which he
calls *Protophysics*, and certain "zerological" principles.


### Analytical Dynamics

```{ .json .config }
{
  "template": "diagram-page.tt",

  "navlang": "theories/es/analytical-dynamics/index.html"
}
```

This lattice compares Newtonian theory with theories of analytical
dynamics, which speak not of particles, but of physical systems and
the evolution of their states. These theories are partially
interpreted and can be applied to different domains. The data comes
from a table on page 123 of the book *Foundations of Physics* (1967)
by Mario Bunge.


### Basic Theories

```{ .json .config }
{
  "template": "diagram-page.tt",
  "output": "theories/en/basic/index.html",
  "navlang": "theories/es/basic/index.html"
}
```

In *"Foundations of Physics"* (1967), Mario Bunge axiomatizes six
physical theories, and some variants, of which we have taken five:
Particle Mechanics and Continuum Mechanics, Classical
Electromagnetism, Relativistic Kinematics and General Relativity. This
network reflects Bunge's additive style that posits special relativity
as prior and fundamental to General Relativity. Compare its location
with the network of classical theories that has a sustractive
approach.


### Space-time Theories

```{ .json .config }
{
  "template": "diagram-page.tt",

  "navlang": "theories/es/spacetimes/index.html"
}
```

This is the ice-berg lattice, the upper tip of the holon of
theories. It takes only the geometric and topological elements to
relate various space-time models. The data comes from the book
*"Foundations of Space-Time Theories: Relativistic Physics and
Philosophy of Science"* by Michael Friedman, as well as the
classification of Niels Dewar (2016, 2018) and Sotiriou and Faraoni
(2010).


### Classical Theories

```{ .json .config }
{
  "template": "diagram-page.tt",
  "output": "theories/en/classical/index.html",
  "navlang": "theories/es/classical/index.html"
}
```

P. Havas (1964) showed that Newtonian theory can be formulated in
4D. Michael Friedman took advantage of this result to characterize it,
along with eight other classic theories in his book *Foundations of
Space-time Theories: Relativistic Physics and Philosophy of
Science*. It is a subtractive reconstruction where the most general
geometric properties are restricted, as is the case of the curvature
of the Riemann tensor. Note that the physical models are located at
the bottom, leaving Special Relativity as a subconcept of General
Relativity. Previous space-time models are located in the middle
part. The upper part is dominated by topology, geometric objects and
their characterizations, as detailed in the Space-Time Theories
lattice. Find here a case of theorization and another of
specialization.


### Metric Theories of Gravitation

```{ .json .config }
{
  "template": "diagram-page.tt",
  "output": "theories/en/metric/index.html",
  "navlang": "theories/es/metric/index.html"
}
```

Metric theories were developed in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s in the
context of space exploration, experiments with radio waves, quantum
technology and high-precision astronomical observations of highly
energetic objects such as quasars. These were classified by Clifford
Will in his book *"Theory and Experiment in Gravitational Physics"*
(1993). The tables on page 117 and the "cookbook" in chapter 5 are
sources for this lattice<!--. An alternating lattice classifies metric
theories based on their post-Newtonian parameters (p. 115). Locate the
viable theories from the non-viable ones-->. These theories consider some extra fields, functions and arbitrary parameters, and changes in the universal gravitation constant G.

### f(R) Gravitation Theories

```{ .json .config }
{
  "template": "diagram-page.tt",
  "output": "theories/en/f-R/index.html",
  "navlang": "theories/es/f-R/index.html"
}
```

The f(R) theories gained interest since the 1980s when it was proposed
to model the inflation scenarios with higher order Ricci scalar
functions, so that singularities were avoided. It sought to preserve
the same principles with which General Relativity was formulated: the
principle of strong equivalence, the movement of particles following
space-time geodesics and without adding extra fields, which is why
they are considered “pure” metric theories. The formal context is
based on the article by Thomas P. Sotiriou and Valerio Faraoni, *"f(R)
theories of gravity"*. Note here that Einstein's equation is shared by
two models. On the other hand, the action can be varied in two
different ways, depending on the dependence of the variables.


### Non-local MoNDian or Extended Theories

```{ .json .config }
{
  "template": "diagram-page.tt",
  "output": "theories/en/mond/index.html",
  "navlang": "theories/es/mond/index.html"
}
```

Along with the f(R) theories, we compare four models of the extended gravitation theory that take the Milgrom
constant as fundamental (Modified Gravity Theories (MoND)), proposing alternative covariant models to the dark matter hypothesis. Two of them
are non-local and assume mass as a function of density. Data obtained
from the work of Barrientos and Mendoza in metric and extended
platinum theories (2016, 2018); Carranza, Mendoza and Torres (2018);
and the article by Sotiriou Faraoni, *"f(R) theories of gravity"*.


### Holon of Gravitational Theories

```{ .json .config }
{
  "template": "diagram-page.tt",
  "output": "theories/en/holon/index.html",
  "navlang": "theories/es/holon/index.html"
}
```

A holon is a theoretical network that interrelates many kinds of
theories. This holon seeks to bring together several of the lattices
presented in the Exploratorium that comply with the same formalism and
notation: supported by the same topology, a covariant formalism and
coordinate-free notation. The data considers the classification of
Thomas P. Sotiriou and Valerio Faraoni in *"f(R) theories of
gravity"*, in the classification of Michael Friedman in *Foundations
of Space-Time Theories: Relativistic Physics and Philosophy of
Science*, in Clifford Will's classification in *Theory and Experiment
on Gravitational Physics*, and in the articles by Sergio Mendoza et
al. (2013, 2016, 2018) on extended local and non-local
theories.

A genealogical tree of gravitation theories formulated between 1905
and 2015. Gray lines traverse the timeline, emanating from two axes
oriented towards the foundational theory of Special Relativity. Within
the temporal expanse, experiments and observations find their
place. Proponents advocating theories, along with the corresponding
publication dates of seminal articles, are highlighted in
green. Fundamental principles underpinning each theory are articulated
at the core of their respective branches. Primary gravitational
theories are distinguished in red, while models elucidating dark
matter and dark energy manifest in yellow. Quantum descriptions of
gravity are found in blue. Clicking the arrows will link to the
corresponding seminal paper.

This arboreal structure encapsulates the historical evolution of
gravitational proposals, providing a visual narrative of the
interconnected web of ideas, experiments, and visionary minds that
have shaped our understanding of gravity over the decades.
