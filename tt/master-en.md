#### At the Exploratorium, we are passionate about unraveling the semantic structure of physical theories through interactive, hyperlinked network visualizations.

These macroscopes are interactive theoretical lattices that represent relations between the fundamental concepts of physical and space-time theories.  Nodes repressent concepts and links represent hierarquical relations of inclusion. Concepts are ordered pairs of attributes (sets of axioms) and objects (classes of models).
The explored theories have been axiomatized under the set theoretical view of structuralism where theories are represented by sets of premises. Theories have a hierarchical internal structure that can be visualized using concept lattices.

Lattices are a class of network with
various properties, such as being partially ordered sets with a unique top and
bottom component for each pair of nodes in the network. Theoretical
lattices locate the fundamental components common to most theories,
at the top, such as protophysics, topological or geometric
properties. Actual models and specialized models, on the other hand,
are found at the lower levels of the lattice.

**Our goal** is to provide visual interactive tools that help us
understand the complexity of physical theories and the relations
between fundamental components. These macroscopes work as conceptual
maps for students and curious people that navigate in the theoretical
sea of physics.

### Methodology

```{ .json .config }
{
  "template": "index.tt",
  "output": "methodology.html",
  "nav_lang": "methodology-es.html"
}
```

We represent theories using a model-based approach and set theory,
following the structuralist school of metatheoretical analysis of
Balzer, Moulines and Sneed (2012). Theories are represented by
theoretical elements made up in part by sets of model classes. In an
incidence table or formal context (G,M,i) we relate classes of models
with their attributes (sets of axioms). **Formal Concept Analysis
(FCA)** is a mathematical theory based on Birckoff's theory of
lattices and Galois' connection which recovers formal concepts
(ordered pairs made up of an extension and intension) from formal
contexts, relates them hierarchically and represents them as lattices.

Each lattice presented here is based on some formal
reconstruction. We have found two types of reconstructions:

- **Additive**, which proposes a very impoverished differential
  manifold to enrich it with geometric properties, a path proposed by
  Bernhard Riemann and found in the axiomatizations of Mario Bunge
  (1967), who gives more weight to the temporal and experimental
  aspects when determining the fundamental level of the concepts, and
  from where we obtained the lattices titled "Protophysics",
  "Analytical Dynamics" and "Basic Theories".
- **Subtractive**, proposed by Felix Klein, begins with a differential
  manifold endowed with many very general properties that are
  constrained as required. It is the path found in Michael Friedman's
  (1983) classifications of "Space-Time Theories" and "Classical
  Theories", Clifford Will's (1981) classification of "Metric
  Theories", Sotiriou and Faraoni (2010) the "f(R) Theories", and the
  "Extended Theories" of Mendoza and Barrientos (2018). These
  reconstructions also share formalism and notation, so it was
  possible to combine them into a large theoretical holon.

### Protophysics

```{ .json .config }
{
  "template": "diagram-page.tt",
  "output": "theories/en/protophysics/index.html",
  "nav_lang": "theories/es/protophysics/index.html"
}
```

The foundations of all physical theories rest on mathematical
theories, logic, semantics and a series of very general assumptions
and theories that in *Foundations of Physics* (1967), Mario Bunge
divides into three groups: the formal base, the material base which he
calls *Protophysics*, and certain "zerological" principles.


### Analytical Dynamics

```{ .json .config }
{
  "template": "diagram-page.tt",
  "output": "theories/en/analytical-dynamics/index.html",
  "nav_lang": "theories/es/analytical-dynamics/index.html"
}
```

This lattice compares Newtonian theory with theories of analytical
dynamics, which speak not of particles, but of physical systems and
the evolution of their states. These theories are partially
interpreted and can be applied to different domains. The data comes
from a table on page 123 of the book *Foundations of Physics* (1967)
by Mario Bunge.


### Basic Theories

```{ .json .config }
{
  "template": "diagram-page.tt",
  "output": "theories/en/basic/index.html",
  "nav_lang": "theories/es/basic/index.html"
}
```

In *"Foundations of Physics"* (1967), Mario Bunge axiomatizes six
physical theories, and some variants, of which we have taken five:
Particle Mechanics and Continuum Mechanics, Classical
Electromagnetism, Relativistic Kinematics and General Relativity. This
network reflects Bunge's additive style that posits special relativity
as prior and fundamental to General Relativity. Compare its location
with the network of classical theories that has a sustractive
approach.


### Space-time Theories

```{ .json .config }
{
  "template": "diagram-page.tt",
  "output": "theories/en/spacetimes/index.html",
  "nav_lang": "theories/es/spacetimes/index.html"
}
```

This is the ice-berg lattice, the upper tip of the holon of
theories. It takes only the geometric and topological elements to
relate various space-time models. The data comes from the book
*"Foundations of Space-Time Theories: Relativistic Physics and
Philosophy of Science"* by Michael Friedman, as well as the
classification of Niels Dewar (2016, 2018) and Sotiriou and Faraoni
(2010).


### Classical Theories

```{ .json .config }
{
  "template": "diagram-page.tt",
  "output": "theories/en/classical/index.html",
  "nav_lang": "theories/es/classical/index.html"
}
```

P. Havas (1964) showed that Newtonian theory can be formulated in
4D. Michael Friedman took advantage of this result to characterize it,
along with eight other classic theories in his book *Foundations of
Space-time Theories: Relativistic Physics and Philosophy of
Science*. It is a subtractive reconstruction where the most general
geometric properties are restricted, as is the case of the curvature
of the Riemann tensor. Note that the physical models are located at
the bottom, leaving Special Relativity as a subconcept of General
Relativity. Previous space-time models are located in the middle
part. The upper part is dominated by topology, geometric objects and
their characterizations, as detailed in the Space-Time Theories
lattice. Find here a case of theorization and another of
specialization.


### Metric Theories of Gravitation

```{ .json .config }
{
  "template": "diagram-page.tt",
  "output": "theories/en/metric/index.html",
  "nav_lang": "theories/es/metric/index.html"
}
```

Metric theories were developed in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s in the
context of space exploration, experiments with radio waves, quantum
technology and high-precision astronomical observations of highly
energetic objects such as quasars. These were classified by Clifford
Will in his book *"Theory and Experiment in Gravitational Physics"*
(1993). The tables on page 117 and the "cookbook" in chapter 5 are
sources for this lattice<!--. An alternating lattice classifies metric
theories based on their post-Newtonian parameters (p. 115). Locate the
viable theories from the non-viable ones-->. These theories consider some extra fields, functions and arbitrary parameters, and changes in the universal gravitation constant G.

### f(R) Gravitation Theories

```{ .json .config }
{
  "template": "diagram-page.tt",
  "output": "theories/en/f-R/index.html",
  "nav_lang": "theories/es/f-R/index.html"
}
```

The f(R) theories gained interest since the 1980s when it was proposed
to model the inflation scenarios with higher order Ricci scalar
functions, so that singularities were avoided. It sought to preserve
the same principles with which General Relativity was formulated: the
principle of strong equivalence, the movement of particles following
space-time geodesics and without adding extra fields, which is why
they are considered “pure” metric theories. The formal context is
based on the article by Thomas P. Sotiriou and Valerio Faraoni, *"f(R)
theories of gravity"*. Note here that Einstein's equation is shared by
two models. On the other hand, the action can be varied in two
different ways, depending on the dependence of the variables.


### Non-local MoNDian or Extended Theories

```{ .json .config }
{
  "template": "diagram-page.tt",
  "output": "theories/en/mond/index.html",
  "nav_lang": "theories/es/mond/index.html"
}
```

Along with the f(R) theories, we compare four models of the extended gravitation theory that take the Milgrom
constant as fundamental (Modified Gravity Theories (MoND)), proposing alternative covariant models to the dark matter hypothesis. Two of them
are non-local and assume mass as a function of density. Data obtained
from the work of Barrientos and Mendoza in metric and extended
platinum theories (2016, 2018); Carranza, Mendoza and Torres (2018);
and the article by Sotiriou Faraoni, *"f(R) theories of gravity"*.


### Holon of Gravitational Theories

```{ .json .config }
{
  "template": "diagram-page.tt",
  "output": "theories/en/holon/index.html",
  "nav_lang": "theories/es/holon/index.html"
}
```

A holon is a theoretical network that interrelates many kinds of
theories. This holon seeks to bring together several of the lattices
presented in the Exploratorium that comply with the same formalism and
notation: supported by the same topology, a covariant formalism and
coordinate-free notation. The data considers the classification of
Thomas P. Sotiriou and Valerio Faraoni in *"f(R) theories of
gravity"*, in the classification of Michael Friedman in *Foundations
of Space-Time Theories: Relativistic Physics and Philosophy of
Science*, in Clifford Will's classification in *Theory and Experiment
on Gravitational Physics*, and in the articles by Sergio Mendoza et
al. (2013, 2016, 2018) on extended local and non-local
theories. 

Locate groups of theories, for example: those that follow a
geodesic, those that have curvature = 0, or the node that selects
metric theories only. What model would that node correspond to?

A genealogical tree of gravitation theories formulated between 1905
and 2015. Gray lines traverse the timeline, emanating from two axes
oriented towards the foundational theory of Special Relativity. Within
the temporal expanse, experiments and observations find their
place. Proponents advocating theories, along with the corresponding
publication dates of seminal articles, are highlighted in
green. Fundamental principles underpinning each theory are articulated
at the core of their respective branches. Primary gravitational
theories are distinguished in red, while models elucidating dark
matter and dark energy manifest in yellow. Quantum descriptions of
gravity are found in blue. Clicking the arrows will link to the
corresponding seminal paper.

This arboreal structure encapsulates the historical evolution of
gravitational proposals, providing a visual narrative of the
interconnected web of ideas, experiments, and visionary minds that
have shaped our understanding of gravity over the decades.
