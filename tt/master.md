#### Get to explore the structure of physical theories through interactive concept networks.

At Space-Time Theories Exploratorium, we are passionate about
unraveling the mysteries of space-time, gravitation and other physical
theories through data visaualizations. These interactive
visualizations are the outcome of a PhD research project on Social
Science and Humanities at Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana, aimed at
representing a big chunk of the semantic structure of gravitation and
other space-time theories through visualizations of concept lattices
obtained using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA).

Physical theories, and scientific knowledge in general, are conceptual
systems; complex objects with different kinds of components related
with other components in a given environment. Structure is the set of
relations between components (internal structure) and the components
of the environment (external structure).  Theories have a hierarchical
internal structure that can be visualized using lattices. Lattices are
class of network with several properties, such as being ordered sets
with a unique top and bottom component for every pair of nodes in the
network. Hierarchy shows the fundamental comon components to most
theories, such as protophysics, topological or geometrical
properties. Specialized models, on the other hand are found in lower
levels or the lattice.

We represent theories using a set-theoretic, model based approach,
following the structuralist school of metatheoretical analysis of
Balzer, Moulines and Sneed (2012). Theories are represented by
theoretic elements that are sets of classes of models. In an incidence
table or formal context (G,M,i) we relate classes of models with their
attributes (sets of axioms). FCA is a mathematical theory and
methology of retriving formal concepts from formal contexts, relate
them hierarchically and represent it as a lattice. Each concept
lattice presented here is based on certain classifications such as
Michael Friedman's classification of space-time theories, Sotiriou and
Faraoni's classification of f(R) theories, Clifford Will's
classification of Metric Theories, Mario Bunge's classification of
Protophysics and physical theories, and Neil Dewar's *"Maxwell
Gravitation"* article, among others.

Our goal is to provide visual interactive tools to understand the
complexity of physical theories and the relations between fundamental
components. These macroscopes work as conceptual maps for students and
curious people that navigate in the theoretical sea of physics.

### Concept Network for Protophysics

```{ .json .config }
{
  "template": "diagram-page.tt",
  "output": "theories-en/protophysics/index.html",
  "nav_lang": "theories-es/protophysics/index.html"
}
```

Data collected from Mario Bunge's *"Foundations of physics"* (1967).


### Concept Network for Analytical Dynamics

```{ .json .config }
{
  "template": "diagram-page.tt",
  "output": "theories-en/analytical-dynamics/index.html",
  "nav_lang": "theories-es/analytical-dynamics/index.html"
}
```

Data collected from Mario Bunge's *"Foundations of physics"* (1967).


### Concept Network for Space-time Theories

  "nav_lang": "theories-es/spacetimes/index.html"
}
```

Physical theories, and scientific knowledge in general, are based on
more fundamental theories and poses a hierarquical structure. General
theories specialize in order to describe the world in more
detail. Here I present some conceptual networks obtained from a formal
concept analysis (FCA). The database was set up from Michael
Friedman's classification in *"Foundations of Space-Time Theories:
Relativistic Physics and Philosophy of Science"*.

  "nav_lang": "theories-es/basic/index.html"
}
```

Physical theories, and scientific knowledge in general, are based on
very fundamental theories and concepts, and possess a hierarquical
structure. General theories specialize in order to describe the world
in more detail. Here I present some concept lattices obtained using

Non-local theories assume mass as a function of density. The database
was set up from Barrientos and Mendoza's work on extended metric and
palatini theories (2016, 2018); Carranza, Mendoza and Torres (2018);
Bernal et al (2012), and Sotiriou and Faraoni's article: *"f(R)
theories of gravity"*.

A holon is a network of theoretical networks, showing interconections
between distant theories. This holon comprises all the networks
previously presented. The database was set up from several formal
classifications, including Thomas P. Sotiriou and Valerio Faraoni's
article: *"f(R) theories of gravity"* and Michael Friedman's
classification in *"Foundations of Space-Time Theories: Relativistic
Physics and Philosophy of Science"*, Clifford Will's Book *"Theory and
Experiment on Gravitational Physics"*, and Sergio Mendoza's non-local
theories.
